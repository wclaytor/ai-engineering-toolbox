# Creating tasks for Copilot

When working through Issues in GitHub we want to assign issues to Copilot whenever appropriate. Therefore, we need to specify our Issues with the right format and level of granularity to will allow Copilot to focus and accomplish the isolated Task, and for another Team Member to review the PR before merging.

## Making Sure Your Issues Are Well-Scoped

Copilot performs better with clear, well-scoped tasks. Ideal tasks include:
- A clear problem description
- Complete acceptance criteria
- Directions on which files to change

Think of the issue as a prompt for Copilot.

# Instructions
Review each Epic in the current Plan.md file and create a Task  for each Issue in the Epic. Format the Tasks as User Stories, for example:
```
As a <ROLE>
I want <REQUEST>
So that I can <GOAL>
```

You can adjust the exact wording based on the specific User Story but stick to that accepted format
 
The Task should also include clear and verifiable Acceptence Criteria.

* Format the document in Markdown so that we can copy it to Tasks.md
