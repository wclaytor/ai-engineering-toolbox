# AI Stars - Reformat Your Starred Repositories Into Markdown

We are updating the README.md file to add new projects. We are using the starred repositories from your GitHub account to find new projects to add. This used to be a manual process, but now we can automate it.

# Instructions
You will receive a list of your starred repositories from GitHub. Your task is to reformat the information into a Markdown format that matches the existing README.md file structure.

You have a text copy and the full HTML output of the Starred Repositories page. Use the text copy as the primary source list of repositories. For each repository in the list, create a Markdown entry that includes the project name, URL, and description (if available). The text copy will not include the URLs, so you will need to extract them from the HTML output.

You can use the following format for each repository:

```markdown
### LangChain
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain

#### Description
LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development â€” all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.
```

Do not include any additional information or context. Just reformat the starred repositories into the specified Markdown format.

Make sure to include the project name, URL, and description in the same format as shown above. If a repository does not have a description, you can omit the "#### Description" section.

Do not include the Table of Contents or any other sections. Just provide the reformatted Markdown for each starred repository.
