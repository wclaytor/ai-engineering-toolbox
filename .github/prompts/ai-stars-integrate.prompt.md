# AI Stars - Reformat Your Starred Repositories Into Markdown

We are updating the README.md file to add new projects. We are using the starred repositories from your GitHub account to find new projects to add. This used to be a manual process, but now we can automate it.

# Instructions
We have already converted the new entries into the correct format. Your task is to integrate these entries into the existing README.md file.

Review each project entry in the attached Markdown file and perform the following steps:
1. **Check for Duplicates**: Ensure that the project is not already listed in the README.md file.
2. **Check for Appropriateness**: If the project is not a duplicate, evaluate whether it fits the criteria for inclusion in the README.md file. IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT SEEM APPROPRIATE, IMMEDIATELY PAUSE AND SEEK ASSISTANCE.
3. **Integrate the Project**: If the project is appropriate, add it to the README.md file in the correct section. IF THERE IS NO EXISTING SECTION FOR THE PROJECT, IMMEDIATELY PAUSE AND SEEK ASSISTANCE.
4. **Preserve Formatting**: Ensure that the formatting of the README.md file remains consistent with the existing entries.

Create a new version of the README.md file with the integrated entries. If you encounter any issues or have questions about specific projects, please pause and seek assistance before proceeding.
