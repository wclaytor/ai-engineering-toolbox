## syftr
https://github.com/datarobot/syftr

Efficient Search for Pareto-optimal Flows

### Description
syftr is an agent optimizer that helps you find the best agentic workflows for a given budget. You bring your own dataset, compose the search space from models and components, and syftr finds the best combination of parameters for your budget. It uses advances in multi-objective Bayesian Optimization and a novel domain-specific "Pareto Pruner" to efficiently sample a search space of agentic and non-agentic flows to estimate a Pareto-frontier (optimal trade-off curve) between accuracy and objectives that compete like cost, latency, throughput.

## Semantifly
https://github.com/accretional/semantifly

### Description
Semantifly
Semantifly is a command line tool for implementing local RAG for the GenAI-for-coding use case.

Users add data, or entire data sources like code repos and cloud projects, and Semantifly automatically gathers all the data corresponding to that data source (such as databases and other resources within a cloud project), serializes them as text and vector embeddings, and adds them to a local vector database. It then provides the necessary funcitonality for this database to be integrated with a LLM to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation with the index data - instead of having to manually tell the LLM what your database schema is, or the structure of an API in another repo within your organization, it can automatically retrive and access that data.

This is currently a work in progress.

## Prompt Tower
https://github.com/backnotprop/prompt-tower

### Description
Turn your entire codebase into AI-ready context in seconds

VS Code Extension Rating Users

The Problem
Copy-pasting files into Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor one by one. Losing track of context. Getting generic solutions because the AI doesn't understand your architecture. Sound familiar?

The Solution
Select files with checkboxes → Generate perfect context → Copy to clipboard → Paste anywhere.

Prompt Tower packages your codebase—files, directory structure, GitHub issues—into AI-optimized prompts. Built for developers using Gemini's 1M context, Cursor's agent, Claude Code, or any AI assistant.
